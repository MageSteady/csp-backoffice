# MageSteady CSP Backoffice

## Description

**MageSteady CSP Backoffice module for Magento 2** allows you to manage and edit the Content Security Policy (CSP) directly from the admin panel, instead of modifying XML files.

This is particularly useful for teams where non-developers manage tagging strategies through tools like Google Tag Manager or directly from the Design configuration in the Magento backoffice.

This module also allows you to collect and view CSP violation reports from the Magento admin panel.

You can also use this module to fix the "CSP header is too large" issue by cleaning up useless values from Magento core and other modules.

If you have multiple themes installed, you will also be able to have different rules for each store view.

## Known Issues

### CSP header is too large
**Description:** Header size is limited to 8k by default in nginx and Apache. This can be an issue if you have too many rules in your Content Security Policy, as all the rules will be stacked one after the other in the same "Content-Security-Policy" header.

**Workaround:** Try removing some unnecessary rules in your configuration. If you can't get them to fit in the 8k default limitation, you should raise the maximum header size in your nginx/Apache configuration.

### Can't login to backoffice after activating Restrict mode
**Description:** If you have enabled adminhtml reCAPTCHA and you didn't allow Google reCAPTCHA's script to be loaded, you are banned from the backoffice and can't log in. 

**Workaround:** Run this command `bin/magento config:set magesteady_csp_backoffice/general/enable_restrict_mode_adminhtml 0`, flush the cache, then add the reCAPTCHA script to your rules and enable Restrict mode again.

### CSP violation reports are not collected properly
**Description:** I have enabled violation reports and they are not showing in the backoffice

**Workaround:** CSP violation reports are queued in your visitors' browser and they are sent when the browser is idle. Please wait a few moments before it appears in your backoffice. You must also be aware that CSP violations are only reported to publicly accessible websites with a valid SSL certificate.
